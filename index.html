        <img id="imgleft" src=assets/images/profileplaceholder.jpg>My name is Andrew Finkernagel. From 2006 until 2018, I was self-employed as a professional poker player. As my life circumstances changed, I realized that the time was right for me to embark on a new career. I was attracted to the technology and development field, since it would offer me another career that offered me the opportunity to grow and improve through experience. Poker was a harsh meritocracy, where better performance yielded better results in the long run. The lessons I learned from my poker career will prepare me greatly to be successful as a web developer.
